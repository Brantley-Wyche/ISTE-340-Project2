# ISTE-340-Project2
jQuery Website Project for Client Programming


This is a redesign of a school project that communicates with an old version of RIT's Information Science and Technology Department API.

jQuery is used to handle all of the incoming data and display it on the webpage.  MDBootstrap is used for styling as well.  Sass is also used for my personal stylesheet.

Some information was out of date or irrelevant and needed to be cut.  The images for the faculty and staff are also out of date, but they are important to this project, so they were kept.

Finally, here's a link to the working webpage: https://people.rit.edu/~bxw5869/ISTE340/Wyche_Project2/
